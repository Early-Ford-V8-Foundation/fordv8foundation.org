David Pearson decided to recreate his first race car, a 1937 Ford, as a never-can-lose car, and that is exactly what happened! This car had a winning streak of 5 years! The family has not showcased this car anywhere since David last drove it, but has now graciously loaned it to our museum to share with the world. 

Take advantage of this opportunity to see this historic car and another one of David's cars, the 1939 Ford!
