  of these Beautiful Automobiles! "
description: "We have everything you need to provide an engaging learning
  experience for your students! You will have access to our educational
  materials on google classroom to use before, during and after your visit. Your
  students will learn the historical context of the automobiles during the
  1930's, 40's and early 50's, as well as the significance of their design.
  Typically, 90 minutes is ample time for a tour. There is ample space in the
  event center for your class to eat their sack lunch, if you wish. Contact us
  to plan your visit! "
