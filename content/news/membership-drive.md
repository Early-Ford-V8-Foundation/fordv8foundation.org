Do you or a loved one love classic cars and particularly Fords? Especially Ford v-8's? Consider becoming a member or gifting a membership today!  You don't have to own a Ford V-8 to be a member, just appreciate them! 

We are an educational foundation, with a goal of inspiring future generations to take an interest in this great era of Fords. We do this through a Youth Mechanics program, special events such as learning how to drive manual transmissions in cool classic cars, hosting fun events, and supporting youth in the Great Race competition. 

For $25 a year, a member gets unlimited visits to the museum with a guest, the newsletter magazine 6 times a year, a discounted swap meet space at our large Fall Swap Meet, access to our archival library, and opportunities to participate in fun events throughout the year with other great car enthusiasts! 

$60 gets a 3 year membership, and Lifetime membership is $600. 

This makes a fun, unique gift that they can enjoy and be connected to like-minded people.  

What an affordable way to add experiences to your life!
