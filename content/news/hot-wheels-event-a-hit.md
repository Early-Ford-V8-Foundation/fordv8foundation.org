The first annual Hot Wheels event was held Saturday, October 11 in the J. Windle Event Center and was well attended! Over 75 kids and an estimated 300 adults enjoyed competing on 2 large specialty tracks brought by the Indianapolis Hot Wheels Club. Kids participated in a number of heats to start the tournament. Prizes included trophies, Hot Wheels boxed track sets, museum gift cards, and Hot Wheels cars. 

Guests were treated to a REAL Hot Wheels Camaro displayed neat the entrance. This car belongs to Kimberly Bergdall, who graciously agreed to bring it to the event. See Facebook posts for more photos. 

Winners posed in front of the huge 10x10 racetrack background screen. 

Between races kids played with non-competitive tracks, played Racecar Bingo for prizes, made race car ornaments, designed their own race car with stickers and coloring, or shopped among the 14 vendors. 

The Hot Wheels Club and all the vendors are enthusiastic about coming back next year! It will be bigger and better!
