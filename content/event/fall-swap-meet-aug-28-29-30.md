The Early Ford V-8 Foundation is host to the annual Fall Swap Meet during Auburn's Auburn Cord Duesenberg Festival before Labor Day. This swap meet keeps growing every year-  Over 136 vendors and 70 cars in the car corral were here last year! 

If you are interested in being a vendor, become a member of the Early Ford V-8 Foundation for $25 year membership dues, $60 for a three year membership.  This will give you one FREE large swap meet space. $50 for a second space.  Car Corral spaces are $50 and for members only, as well.  Call the Early Ford V-8 Museum for more information at 260-927-8022 - Deb Sharp will be your contact. 

Come out to the Fall Swap Meet and enjoy Timmy's BBQ for lunch while you shop, and then cool down with a walk through the beautiful Early Ford V-8 Museum!
