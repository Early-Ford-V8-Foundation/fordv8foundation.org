The Early Ford V-8 Museum will be starting a training program for docents in November so you will be ready to start in January! A docent is basically a friendly and knowledgeable tour guide. We provide the information and training you will need to be a confident docent. Call Jan for details at 260-927-8022 or email at jan@fordv8foundation.org. 

If you are looking for expanding your knowledge in history and cars and meeting interesting people from around the country and world, then this is the place for you!
