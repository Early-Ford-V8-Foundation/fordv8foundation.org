The Early Ford V-8 Museum will be open all Memorial Day Weekend, including Monday! 

Sat, Sun, and Mon. from 12-3:00, join in on the extended "Sunday Talks" with Scott Campbell, great-great nephew to Henry and Clara Ford, as he shares his passion with all things Henry Ford. Henry did much more than produce the Model T and improve the assembly line! Our highways are evidence of his contributions! 

Then tour this BEAUTIFUL museum featuring classic automobiles from the flathead engine era of 1932-1953. You will walk away truly amazed!

Bring the kids! They will have fun doing the scavenger hunt and getting a Henry Ford coin booklet! 

Come see the new exhibit NASCAR fans! NASCAR Legend David Pearson's two Ford cars are here! This is truly a HUGE DEAL for the automotive racing world!! 

So much to see and learn here, don't miss it!
