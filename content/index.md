 text: "We are a one of a kind museum featuring Henry Fordâ€™s flathead engine era 1932-
1953. You will find a great variety of automobiles, from woodies to Lincoln
Zephyrs, from panel delivery trucks to large commercial trucks, from 1932
cabriolets to 1953 two-toned sedans. Other special attractions include Ford
tractors, a speed shop, mechanics garage, and a replica 1936 Ford dealership
featuring every model Henry put out that year, including the beautiful stainless
steel sedan on the turn table! No ropes means you can get closer to these
automobiles, although we ask you not touch them. Take all the photos you want!
Plan on at least 45 minutes to enjoy over 65 autos."

### About Us

The Early Ford V-8 Foundation and Museum is a 501(c)(3) educational organization dedicated to
sharing the historical impact Henry Ford and his company, The Ford Motor Company, had on
the United States, and indeed, the world, with a focus on the Flathead years of 1932-1953. We
do this by creating educational and engaging displays and activities in the Early Ford V-8
Museum and offering youth programs and special event classes throughout the year that give
them a hands-on experience with these automobiles.
