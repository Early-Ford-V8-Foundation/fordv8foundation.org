Experience a unique, one of a kind gallery! We have a replica 1936 Ford dealership featuring every model Ford produced that year. This includes the gorgeous stainless steel sedan rotating on the turn- table in the rotunda and several rare automobiles. 

This gallery is made possible through the generosity of Joe and Elaine Floyd from South Dakota. Together they decided in retirement to find and restore every model Ford produced in 1936. Joe was born in 1936 and thought the '36 Fords were the most beautiful pre-war designs Ford ever made. 

Joe wrote a book titled "Floyd V8" that details all 18 automobiles in this fabulous collection, that you can buy on our website. Loaded with photos of each car, and the whole back story, it is an entertaining and educational book for any Ford fanatic.
