As an educational foundation, our purpose is to educate young and old about the great history of Henry Ford’s flathead V-8 era, and inspire an interest to learn more!

Starting with elementary age students, and up, we provide fantastic
teacher resources for an in-depth learning experience through immersive
museum tours and a treasure trove of pre-made classroom activities stored on a
google classroom that teachers may access before and after their tour.

Teenagers can participate in our Youth Mechanics Classes and learn how to
work on classic cars!

Throughout the year, we offer “Third Pedal” classes, where youth learn to
drive a manual transmission on a classic car.

Unique events are scheduled throughout the year for all ages, such as our
Sunday Talks with special guest speakers, special tours, and seasonal events.

Group tours for home schoolers, senior living facilities, community
organizations and businesses are guided with knowledgeable docents to provide
the back story in this fascinating history with Henry Ford.

Take advantage of this hidden gem in your backyard! Do something
different and learn something new this week! Whether by yourself, your family or
some friends, the Early Ford V-8 Museum is a unique way to spend an hour or
two!
